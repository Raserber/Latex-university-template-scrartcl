# Latex Template for University

LaTeX Template made by myself for my note taking, my practical work reports or my project files reports (including electrical implementation diagrams, C or  Natural language or over programming language like ST (industry automation) etc...)

> The general shape of the rendering is done with the **KOMA-SCRIPT class scrartcl** (European version of standart class "Article" especially to adapt the layout to A4 format and over benefits)
